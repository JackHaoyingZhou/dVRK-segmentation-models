# Recording script

The following recording script was adapted from the ros package hosted at https://github.com/Cartucho/dvrk_record_video.

The script is used to record video from ros topics. A configuration file is used to specify the topics to record. This script can found in the `surg_seg/Scripts/RosVideoRecording` directory.

For more information run:

```bash
ros_video_record.py --help
```
